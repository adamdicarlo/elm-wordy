# Wordy

Wordy is a clone of an iOS game called [Worder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worder/id295069415?mt=8), but written in Elm.

The objective is to spell as many words as possible using the nine given letters.

Each word must be three letters or longer (later, this will be configurable at runtime!).

You can use the keyboard to enter guesses or click on the big letters.

To try it out, clone this repo and run these commands:

```
    yarn install
    yarn start
```

(If you don't have `yarn` installed, just use `npm` instead!)
