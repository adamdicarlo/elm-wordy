# Wordy

Wordy is a clone of an iOS game called [Worder](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/worder/id295069415?mt=8), but written in Elm.

The objective is to spell as many words as possible using the nine given letters.

Each word must be three letters or longer.

It doesn't do a whole lot yet, but has basic playability for a single nine-letter word.

To try it out, clone this repo and run these commands:

```
    yarn install
    yarn start
```

(If you don't have `yarn` installed, just use `npm` instead!)
